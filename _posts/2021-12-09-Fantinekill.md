Fantinekill Falls in Ellenville, NY

Unless you live in the region, you likely would not have heard of Fantinekill. It’s a small community in the Rondout Valley nestled between the Catskill and Shawangunk Mountains that has existed since colonial times. And what Fantinekill is known for is less about its charming waterfall featured here or the natural beauty that surrounds it but instead a massacre that happened there during the Revolutionary War.

Unswerving in their devotion to the revolutionary cause, defenseless settlers stayed put while being attacked by loyalists to the British Crown perhaps to subdue, soften the patriotic spirit, or merely for loot and plunder.

In 1779, in one such attack, two women and their combined seven children were massacred in Fantinekill. A monument was erected in 1903 at the site of their burial to honor the victims. The monument is located about 500 yards from Fantinekill Cemetery.

It's a rather odd combination to visit—a waterfall and a cemetery. Peace and quiet is present in both places but in quite different circumstances.

Or are they really that different? From the book, “Origin Story” (2018) by David Christian (text in parenthesis are mine):

“In gases, atoms zoom about like hyperactive kids, so it’s hard to keep them still enough to hitch up with other atoms (and form molecular bonds). In solids...atoms are locked in place. But liquids are like ballrooms, and liquid water...offers the best ballroom for all. Atoms can cruise, waltz, and tango, and it’s not too hard for electrons to change partners if they spot something more attractive (think of the coffee or tea you brew every morning or your body being made up of 60% water)...In such a chemically rich environment (such as planet Earth where being not too close and not too far from the sun liquid water can form in abundance) many of the simple molecules from which life is built can form more or less spontaneously.”

In other words, water is life. Perhaps a visit to Fantinekill could serve as stark reminder that grief must be short-lived for life continues...
